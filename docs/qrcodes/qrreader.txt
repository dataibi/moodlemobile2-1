Site for creation:
http://goqr.me/de/

Or for many codes:
Please use the ./qr_form file:
http://www.moodle.mathetics.eu/theme/badges/qr_loop_form.php

On Linux better install libqrencode:
https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en
and use the generate.sh script. Change the filename (in the script) for the csv file in which the strings for the qr COde are.
For this script the separator in the qr_form has to be "line".

and the following generator:
https://qrexplore.com/generate/
Options are in the ./qr_settings.png
Here in the qr_form the separator has to be semicolon.


QrCode has to have a qrType property like this:

{"username": "nicename", "password": "nicepassword", "qrType": "login"}

known qrTypes are "login" and "section" so far

Login Qr Code:
{"username": "nicename", "password": "nicepassword", "qrType": "login"}



You have to thave at least one "room" in the project.

If you have one or more maps for the rooms, the qr code for the exhibits has to be like:
{"exhibit": {"map": 1,"room":1,"exponat":2}, "qrType": "section"}

without maps:
{"exhibit": {"room":1,"exponat":2}, "qrType": "section"}

Theese are the same json strings like the ones in the topic summary.
