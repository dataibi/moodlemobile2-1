Site for creation:
http://goqr.me/de/

Or for many codes:
Please use the ./qr_form file:
http://www.moodle.mathetics.eu/theme/badges/qr_loop_form.php

and the following generator:
https://qrexplore.com/generate/
Options are in the ./qr_settings.png


QrCode has to have a qrType property like this:

{"username": "nicename", "password": "nicepassword", "qrType": "login"}

known qrTypes are "login" and "section" so far

Login Qr Code:
{"username": "nicename", "password": "nicepassword", "qrType": "login"}



You have to thave at least one "room" in the project.

If you have one or more maps for the rooms, the qr code for the exhibits has to be like:
{"exhibit": {"map": 1,"room":1,"exponat":2}, "qrType": "section"}

without maps:
{"exhibit": {"room":1,"exponat":2}, "qrType": "section"}

Theese are the same json strings like the ones in the topic summary.
